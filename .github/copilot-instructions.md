The project aims to show what I learn from the course "Multi-Criteria Optimization and Decision Analysis". The course covers Linear_Programming, Metaheuristics_MOO, Voting_Theory and MCDA. It uses uv and python 3.14.

## Structure

- `other_games/`: contains the code for the games other than the main game "Aion's Edge"
- `src/`: contains the code for the main game "Aion's Edge"
- `config/`: contains the configuration files for the project
- `tests/`: contains the test code for the project
- `README.md`: contains the project description and instructions

## Python Instructions

- Write clear and concise comments for each function.
- Ensure functions have descriptive names and include type hints.
- Provide docstrings following PEP 257 conventions.
- Use the `typing` module for type annotations (e.g., `List[str]`, `Dict[str, int]`).
- Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions.

## General Instructions

- Always prioritize readability and clarity.
- For algorithm-related code, include explanations of the approach used.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments.
- Use consistent naming conventions and follow language-specific best practices.
- Write concise, efficient, and idiomatic code that is also easily understandable.

## Code Style and Formatting

- Follow the **PEP 8** style guide for Python.
- Maintain proper indentation (use 4 spaces for each level of indentation).
- Ensure lines do not exceed 79 characters.
- Place function and class docstrings immediately after the `def` or `class` keyword.
- Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and code blocks where appropriate.
